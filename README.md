# FIFA19
I will be using data from FIFA 19 complete player dataset on kaggle-Detailed attributes for every player registered in the latest edition of FIFA 19 database.
Since the Dataset has many columns, we will only focus on a subset of categorical and continuous columns.
This is a nicely formatted data, yet we need to dosome preprocessing to the Wage and Value columns(as they are in Euro and contain strings) to make them numeric for our subsequent analysis.
